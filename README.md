Instructions for Students

How to Run the Lab:

Read the prompt on the left (e.g., "Update this button to use the brand color variable").

Type the correct CSS code into the Code Editor box.

Click Check Code.

If correct, the preview updates, and the progress bar advances.

If incorrect, the box turns red.

Instructor / Deployment Notes

To Share via Canvas:
Upload interactive_css_lab.html to the Assignment or Module. Instruct students to download it rather than previewing it inside Canvas (Canvas previews often block the JavaScript needed for the interactivity).

To Share via Netlify:

Put interactive_css_lab.html into a folder named week-03-lab.

Rename the file to index.html.

Drag the folder to app.netlify.com/drop.

Share the generated link.
